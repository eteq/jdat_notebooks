# James Webb Space Telescope Data Analysis Tool Notebooks

 The ``jdat_notebooks`` repository contains notebooks illustrating workflows for post-pipeline analysis of JWST data. Some of the notebooks also illustrate generic analysis workflows that are applicable to data from other observatories as well.
 This repository and the notebooks are one component of STScI's larger [Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis).

  Contributions are welcome from both the scientist and developer community.  If you wish to contribute fixes or clarifications to existing notebooks, feel free to do so directly to this repository.  If you wish to contribute new notebooks or major reworks of existing notebooks, we refer you to [dat_pyinthesky](https://github.com/spacetelescope/dat_pyinthesky/tree/main/jdat_notebooks).  For details on how to provide such contributions, see the [contributing instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md).

 The notebooks attempt to utilize a number of software packages supported by STScI, including [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org), [glue](http://docs.glueviz.org/en/stable/index.html), [ginga](https://ginga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io), [specutils](https://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [astroimtools](http://astroimtools.readthedocs.io), [imexam](http://imexam.readthedocs.io), [jdaviz](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [asdf](http://asdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [gwcs](https://gwcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [synphot](http://synphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  Note jdaviz is STScI's JWST Data Analysis Visualization Tool, designed to be used with spectra, IFU cubes, and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS).

## Getting the notebooks

You can view rendered versions of the notebooks at https://spacetelescope.github.io/jdat_notebooks/, which require no special tools beyond your web browser.

To download and execute the notebooks, clone this repository to your local computer. Most of the notebooks
rely on packages that are available in [astroconda](https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), although
a few rely on packages that should be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). The version
dependencies are listed in the `environment.yaml` and in the `requirements` file in each notebook folder.
